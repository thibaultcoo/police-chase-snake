# Enhanced Snake Game with AI-like Police

*Produced by Thibault Collin within the scope of the M203 Python class.*

We designed a snake game with multiple new features, including special food elements, non-crossable obstacles and an AI-like cop that tries to capture the snake. We used the library <ins>pygame</ins> for the global framework of our game.

*Question 1:* give the snake the ability to go through the screen on all sides 

```python 
is_breaching()
```

*Question 2:* add a second type of food that increments the score by two

```python 
ate_food()
```

*Question 3:* add a third type of food that accelerates the game for five seconds

```python 
handle_accelerators()
```

*Question 4:* add non-crossable obstacles to the game

```python 
build_pattern()
```

*Question 5:* add non-crossable obstacles to the game

```python 
police()
```
